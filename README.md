In order to add Xadow board to the Arduino IDE you're supposed to do all this nonsense on this page:

http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Xadow_Main_Board

Theres support in arduino 1.0.x for different board types in your local sketchbook so I combined all that here.

Create (documents)/Arduino/hardware/ if you have to and place this folder there. Restart Arduino. If everything went to plan you have Seeeduino Xadow in your Boards selection.

Note this probably wont work for Arduino 1.5.x as theres a new system in place.
